# Responder Prompt Update - Complete ✅

## Summary

Successfully restructured the `app/docs/responder.md` system prompt to be a clear, well-organized guide for the LLM voice agent while fixing the prompt loading issue.

## Changes Made

### 1. Restructured System Prompt

**New Structure (Better Flow):**
1. **WHO YOU ARE** - Identity, core role, approach
2. **WHAT DATA YOU RECEIVE** - Dynamic variables and user_overview structure
3. **HOW TO GATHER BIRTH DATA** - Critical rules, collection strategy
4. **YOUR PERSONALITY & TONE** - Voice characteristics, 80/20 balance, language
5. **HOW TO USE MEMORY SYSTEMS** - Incident map, conversations, gamification, horoscope
6. **HOW TO RESPOND** - Response structure, chart insights, predictions
7. **SAFETY BOUNDARIES & ETHICS** - What you are NOT, crisis handling
8. **ENDING CONVERSATIONS** - Protocol and farewell phrases
9. **CLOSING MANTRA** - Final empowerment

**Improvements:**
- Removed all emojis (cleaner, more professional)
- Better section hierarchy (clear H1/H2 structure)
- Stronger personality voice throughout
- More actionable guidance for the LLM
- Complete examples with context
- Emphasis on data usage and dynamic variables

### 2. Removed Fence Blocks

**Before:** System prompt was wrapped in ```markdown fence blocks with metadata
**After:** Pure markdown document (entire file IS the prompt)

This simplifies the loading logic and removes parsing complexity.

### 3. Fixed Prompt Loader

**File:** `app/src/lib/prompt-loader.ts`

**Before:** Complex regex parsing to extract content from fence blocks
**After:** Simple file read - entire file content is the prompt

```typescript
// Now just reads the whole file
const source = await readFile(filePath, "utf-8");
cachedResponderPrompt = source.trim();
```

### 4. Content Improvements

**Enhanced Sections:**
- **Memory Systems:** Clear guidance on how to use incident_map without mentioning the term
- **Birth Data Collection:** Stronger emphasis on checking variables first, creating intrigue
- **Famous People Usage:** Better integration for early engagement
- **Response Patterns:** More concrete examples with full context
- **Audio Tags:** Clearer vocal dynamics guidance

**Kept All Important Content:**
- All personality traits and tone guidelines
- Complete data structure examples
- Safety boundaries and ethics
- Hinglish code-switching patterns
- Gamification celebration patterns
- Crisis handling protocols
- Farewell phrases for auto-disconnect

## Verification

```
✅ Prompt loaded successfully
✅ Prompt length: 23,363 characters (~23KB)
✅ Lines: 618
✅ All major sections present
✅ Clean structure without fence blocks
✅ Linter passed
```

## Integration Status

The prompt is automatically injected when starting a voice session:

**Flow:**
1. User clicks "Start Voice Session"
2. `useSessionHandshake()` fetches `/api/responder/session`
3. Session route calls `getResponderPromptTemplate()`
4. Prompt loaded from `docs/responder.md`
5. Passed to frontend via `handshake.prompt`
6. `useVoiceConnection()` injects it via ElevenLabs SDK:
   ```typescript
   overrides: {
     agent: {
       prompt: {
         prompt: agentPrompt  // Full system prompt
       },
       firstMessage: agentFirstMessage
     }
   }
   ```

## Benefits

1. **Better Organized:** Clear hierarchy makes it easy to find specific guidance
2. **Stronger Personality:** More emphasis on mysterious observation and warm companionship
3. **Data-Focused:** Clear examples of how to use user_overview and dynamic variables
4. **Actionable:** Concrete examples show the LLM exactly how to behave
5. **Maintainable:** Simple markdown structure, no parsing complexity
6. **Complete:** All important content preserved, nothing lost

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Prompt loads without errors
- [x] Complete content (all sections present)
- [x] No fence block parsing issues
- [x] Linter passes
- [x] Correct length (~23KB, appropriate for voice agent)
- [ ] Test in actual voice session (manual testing needed)
- [ ] Verify ElevenLabs receives and uses the prompt correctly

## Next Steps

1. Test the voice session with the new prompt structure
2. Verify agent behavior matches the personality guidelines
3. Check that incident_map callbacks work mysteriously
4. Confirm birth data collection follows the new strategy
5. Validate audio tags create appropriate vocal dynamics
