## Agents Directory

This folder holds conversational agent assets that power the Astra responder experience.

- Store persona/system prompts under dedicated subfolders, e.g. `responder/prompt.md`.
- Keep any supporting configuration alongside the agent that uses it.
- Avoid placing runtime artifacts here; the Next.js app reads prompts at build time.
