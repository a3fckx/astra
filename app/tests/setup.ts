/**
 * GLOBAL TEST SETUP FOR ASTRA APPLICATION
 * =======================================
 * 
 * BUSINESS CONTEXT:
 * =================
 * This setup file configures the testing environment for Astra's critical systems.
 * It ensures that all tests run in a controlled, isolated environment that doesn't
 * interfere with production systems or user data.
 * 
 * 🎯 TESTING OBJECTIVES:
 * =====================
 * 
 * 1. RELIABILITY: Ensure consistent test results across environments
 * 2. ISOLATION: Prevent cross-test contamination and production interference
 * 3. PERFORMANCE: Optimize for fast feedback during development
 * 4. SAFETY: Protect user data and production systems
 * 
 * 🏢 BUSINESS IMPACT:
 * ===================
 * - Development Velocity: Fast tests = quicker iterations
 * - Bug Detection: Early detection prevents production issues
 * - User Experience: Tests ensure features work as expected
 * - Compliance: Validated processes reduce regulatory risk
 * 
 * 🚀 FLAKINESS PREVENTION:
 * =======================
 * - Consistent environment configuration
 * - Proper cleanup and resource management
 * - Timeout configuration for long-running operations
 * - Error handling for external service dependencies
