🔍 WHAT YOUR CONVERSATIONS SHOW:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Based on profile summary:
- "strict English-only communication preference" → hinglish_level should be 0 ✅
- "demand a deeply personalized, 'extremely mysterious' and engaging style" → communication_style could be "balanced"
- "explicit corrections" and "directive" tone → suggests "casual" or "direct" style
- No mention of astrology system preference → system stays null

From recent conversations:
- "corrective, direct, instructional, engaged" → "casual" communication style
- Multiple Hinglish corrections → hinglish_level = 0 ✅ CORRECT

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

❓ WHY ARE SOME FIELDS NULL?
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

The transcript processor task (transcript-processor.yaml line 72-77) expects:

1. communication_style: "casual", "balanced", or "formal"
   → Task must INFER from your tone and language
   → Currently: null (AI hasn't set it yet)
   → Should probably be: "casual" or "balanced" based on your direct style

2. astrology_system: "vedic", "western", or "both"
   → Task only sets this if you EXPLICITLY say preference
   → You haven't said "I prefer Vedic" or "I like Western astrology"
   → Correctly: null (waiting for explicit preference)

3. flirt_opt_in: boolean
   → Task only sets true if you explicitly consent to romantic/flirty tone
   → You haven't mentioned this
   → Correctly: null (defaults to professional tone)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ WHAT'S WORKING:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✓ hinglish_level: 0 (correct - you use 0% Hindi)
✓ topics_of_interest: Auto-updating with new topics from conversations
✓ favorite_astro_topics: Tracking what astrology topics you discuss

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

⚠️  WHAT COULD BE BETTER:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

⚠️  communication_style: null
    → AI should infer "casual" or "balanced" from your direct, engaged tone
    → This affects agent's response style (casual vs formal)
    
⚠️  astrology_system: null
    → This is FINE if you haven't stated a preference
    → Agent provides both Vedic and Western by default
    → Only matters if you explicitly prefer one system

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

💡 HOW TO UPDATE THESE:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

OPTION 1 (Automatic - Requires AI Improvement):
- The transcript task's LLM should be detecting your communication style
- Currently it's being conservative (returning null for unclear fields)
- This is GOOD behavior - better null than wrong assumption

OPTION 2 (Manual Tell Samay):
- Say: "I prefer a casual communication style" → sets to "casual"
- Say: "I like Vedic astrology more" → sets to "vedic"
- Say: "Use both Vedic and Western" → sets to "both"

OPTION 3 (It Doesn't Matter Much):
- communication_style: null → Agent uses "balanced" as default (line 390 responder.md)
- astrology_system: null → Agent offers BOTH systems (line 383 responder.md)
- These nulls are SAFE defaults, not bugs
